# MODiX - A moderation and analysis bot for discord

MODiX is a moderation and analysis bot for discord. As for now, it just deals with moderation, but development should be driven towards analytics to reach our goal in the near future.

## Roadmap & Contributions

Issues are the center of MODiXÂ´s development. You can see what features are being worked on in the issues and you can see which features are planned. You might also create issues to share problems/ideas. 

## Setting it up

MODiX receives its key out of the environment variables. Please set the ENV_Variable MODIX_BOT_KEY to your bot key to get it up and running. Also, a mongodb-server is needed on localhost:DEFAULT.
